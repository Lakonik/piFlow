## Highlights
- **Novel Framework**: pi-Flow stands for policy-based flow models. The network does not output a denoised state; instead, it outputs a fast policy that rolls out multiple ODE substeps to reach the denoised state.

- **Simple Distillation**: pi-Flow adopts policy-based imitation distillation (pi-ID). No JVPs, no auxiliary networks, no GANs‚Äîjust a single L2 loss between the policy and the teacher.

- **Diversity and Teacher Alignment**: pi-Flow mitigates the quality‚Äìdiversity trade-off, generating highly diverse samples while maintaining high quality. It also remains highly faithful to the teacher‚Äôs style. The example below shows that pi-Flow samples generally align with the teacher‚Äôs outputs and exhibit significantly higher diversity than those from DMD students (e.g., [SenseFlow](https://github.com/XingtongGe/SenseFlow), [Qwen-Image Lightning](https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning)).

- **Scalability**: pi-Flow scales from ImageNet DiT to 20-billion-parameter text-to-image models (Qwen-Image). This codebase is highly optimized for large-scale experiments. See the [Codebase](#codebase) section for details.

## Inference: Diffusers Pipelines

We provide diffusers pipelines for easy inference. The following code demonstrates how to sample images from the distilled Qwen-Image and FLUX models.

### [4-NFE GM-Qwen (GMFlow Policy)](demo/example_gmqwen_pipeline.py)
Note: GM-Qwen supports elastic inference. Feel free to set `num_inference_steps` to any value above 4.
```python
import torch
from diffusers import FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler
from lakonlab.pipelines.piqwen_pipeline import PiQwenImagePipeline

pipe = PiQwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
    'Qwen/Qwen-Image',
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
adapter_name = pipe.load_piflow_adapter(  # you may later call `pipe.set_adapters([adapter_name, ...])` to combine other adapters (e.g., style LoRAs)
    'Lakonik/pi-Qwen-Image',
    subfolder='gmqwen_k8_piid_4step',
    target_module_name='transformer')
pipe.scheduler = FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(  # use fixed shift=3.2
    pipe.scheduler.config, shift=3.2, shift_terminal=None, use_dynamic_shifting=False)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

out = pipe(
    prompt='Photo of a coffee shop entrance featuring a chalkboard sign reading "œÄ-Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon '
           'light beside it displaying "œÄ-ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, '
           'and beneath the poster is written "e‚âà2.71828-18284-59045-23536-02874-71352".',
    width=1920,
    height=1080,
    num_inference_steps=4,
    generator=torch.Generator().manual_seed(42),
).images[0]
out.save('gmqwen_4nfe.png')
```
<img src="assets/gmqwen_4nfe.png" width="600" alt=""/>

### [4-NFE GM-FLUX (GMFlow Policy)](demo/example_gmflux_pipeline.py)
Note: For the 8-NFE version, replace `gmflux_k8_piid_4step` with `gmflux_k8_piid_8step` and set `num_inference_steps=8`.
```python
import torch
from diffusers import FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler
from lakonlab.pipelines.piflux_pipeline import PiFluxPipeline

pipe = PiFluxPipeline.from_pretrained(
    'black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev',
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
adapter_name = pipe.load_piflow_adapter(  # you may later call `pipe.set_adapters([adapter_name, ...])` to combine other adapters (e.g., style LoRAs)
    'Lakonik/pi-FLUX.1',
    subfolder='gmflux_k8_piid_4step',
    target_module_name='transformer')
pipe.scheduler = FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(  # use fixed shift=3.2
    pipe.scheduler.config, shift=3.2, use_dynamic_shifting=False)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

out = pipe(
    prompt='A portrait photo of a kangaroo wearing an orange hoodie and blue sunglasses standing in front of the Sydney Opera House holding a sign on the chest that says "Welcome Friends"',
    width=1360,
    height=768,
    num_inference_steps=4,
    generator=torch.Generator().manual_seed(42),
).images[0]
out.save('gmflux_4nfe.png')
```
<img src="assets/gmflux_4nfe.png" width="600" alt=""/>

### 4-NFE DX-Qwen and DX-FLUX (DX Policy)

See [example_dxqwen_pipeline.py](demo/example_dxqwen_pipeline.py) and [example_dxflux_pipeline.py](demo/example_dxflux_pipeline.py) for examples of using the DX policy.

## Inference: Gradio Apps

We provide Gradio apps for interactive inference with the distilled GM-Qwen and GM-FLUX models. 
Official apps are available on HuggingFace Spaces: [pi-Qwen Demoü§ó](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lakonik/pi-Qwen) and [pi-FLUX Demoü§ó](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lakonik/pi-FLUX.1).

Run the following commands to launch the apps locally:

```bash
python demo/gradio_gmqwen.py --share  # GM-Qwen elastic inference
```
```bash
python demo/gradio_gmflux.py --share  # GM-FLUX 4-NFE and 8-NFE inference
```

<img src="assets/gradio_apps.jpg" width="600" alt=""/>

## Toy Models
To aid understanding, we provide minimal toy model training scripts that overfit the teacher behavior on a fixed initial noise using a static GMFlow policy (without student network). 

Run the following command to distill a toy model from a ImageNet DiT (REPA):
```bash
python demo/train_piflow_dit_imagenet_toymodel.py
```
<img src="assets/piflow_dit_imagenet_toymodel.png" width="200" alt=""/>

Run the following command to distill a toy model from Qwen-Image (requires 40GB VRAM):
```bash
python demo/train_piflow_qwen_toymodel.py
```
<img src="assets/piflow_qwen_toymodel.png" width="600" alt=""/>

The results of these toy models demonstrate the expressiveness of the GMFlow policy‚Äîa GMFlow policy with 32 components can fit the entire ODE trajectory from $t=1$ to $t=0$, making it theoretically possible for 1-NFE generation. In practice, the bottleneck is often the student network, not the policy itself, thus more NFEs are still needed.

## Training and Evaluation

Follow the instructions in the following links to reproduce the main results in the paper:
- [Distilling ImageNet DiT](configs/piflow_imagenet/README.md)
- [Distilling Qwen-Image](configs/piqwen/README.md)
- [Distilling FLUX](configs/piflux/README.md)

By default, checkpoints will be saved into [checkpoints/](checkpoints/), logs will be saved into [work_dirs/](work_dirs/), and sampled images will be saved into [viz/](viz/). These directories can be changed by modifying the config file (AWS S3 URLs are supported).
If existing checkpoints are found, training will automatically resume from the latest checkpoint. The training logs can be plotted using Tensorboard. Run the following command to start Tensorboard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir work_dirs/
```

To use Wandb logging, please export your authentication key to the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable, and then enable Wandb logging by appending the following code to the `hooks` list in the `log_config` part of the config file:
```python
dict(
    type='WandbLoggerHook',
    init_kwargs=dict(project='PiFlow'),  # init_kwargs are passed to wandb.init()
)
```

## Codebase

<img src="assets/lakonlab.png" width="200"  alt=""/>

pi-Flow and [GMFlow](configs/gmflow/README.md) are powered by **LakonLab**, a high-performance codebase for experimenting with large diffusion models. Key features of LakonLab include:
- **Performance optimizations**: Seamless switching between DDP, FSDP, and FSDP2, all supporting gradient accumulation and mixed precision.
- **Weight tying**: For LoRA fine-tuning, the base weights of the teacher, student, and EMA models are tied, sharing the same underlying memory. This is compatible with DDP and FSDP.
- **Advanced flow solvers**
  - [FlowSDEScheduler](lakonlab/models/diffusions/schedulers/flow_sde.py): Generic flow SDE solver with an adjustable [diffusion coefficient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02063). `h=0` corresponds to a flow ODE; `h=1` corresponds to a standard flow SDE; `h='inf'` corresponds to the re-noising sampler in the original [consistency models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01469). Powers the GM-SDE solver in GMFlow.
  - [FlowAdapterScheduler](lakonlab/models/diffusions/schedulers/flow_adapter.py): Adapts diffusion solvers for flow matching models. Supports `UniPCMultistep`, `DPMSolverMultistep`, `DPMSolverSinglestep`, `DEISMultistep`, `SASolver`, etc.
- **Storage backends**: Most I/O operations (e.g., dataloaders, checkpoint I/O) support both local filesystems and AWS S3. In addition, model checkpoints can be loaded from HuggingFace (link format `huggingface://<HF_REPO_NAME>/<PATH_TO_MODEL>`) and HTTP/HTTPS URLs directly.
- **Streamlined training and evaluation**: Supports online evaluation using common [metrics](lakonlab/evaluation/metrics.py), including FID, KID, IS, Precision, Recall, CLIP similarity, [VQAScore](https://github.com/linzhiqiu/t2v_metrics), [HPSv2](https://github.com/tgxs002/HPSv2), [HPSv3](https://github.com/MizzenAI/HPSv3), and more.
- **Diffusers-friendly**: Diffusers models can be wrapped and integrated into LakonLab. See examples in [configs/misc](configs/misc) and [lakonlab/models/architecture/diffusers](lakonlab/models/architecture/diffusers).

LakonLab uses the configuration system and code structure from [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv).
